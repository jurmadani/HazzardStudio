Change of plans: work with UI libraries, create more designs and work just on UI.
Don't care about the logic at the moment/backend. We want to finish as fast as possible and try something elements

1)Create animation + modal cand este gata o programare
2)Finish drawer screens
3)more designs



2)Add Logic to the Login screen for the buttons, implement redux from now on.
3)Make other designs after that
