Change of plans: work with UI libraries, create more designs and work just on UI.
Don't care about the logic at the moment/backend. We want to finish as fast as possible and try something elements

1)Finish the drawer, make the header contain the header text + description 
2)Finish the drawer content
3)finish the homepage
4)more designs



2)Add Logic to the Login screen for the buttons, implement redux from now on.
3)Make other designs after that
